# Atomic Network Construction Script

Utility script takes atomic data in the format produced by the LAMMPS "write_data" command and constructs a network based on specified rules.

## Usage

To use this script, follow the steps below:
1. Install the necessary dependencies.
2. Prepare the input atomic data file in the format generated by the LAMMPS "write_data" command.
3. Run the script using the following command:
```
python network.py <input_file_path> [output_file_name]
```
4. The script will construct the network and output the modified atomic data.

## Explanation

The script applies the following rules to construct the network:

1. Two atoms are considered bonded if the distance between them is less than or equal to the sum of their atomic radii.
2. Atoms with less than two bonds are iteratively deleted until all atoms in the network have at least three bonds.

By default, all atoms are assigned the same atom type of 1 and a mass of 1.0 units. You can modify these values in the script if needed.

Please ensure that your input atomic data file adheres to the LAMMPS format and contains the necessary information, i.e., atomic data in the proper format.
